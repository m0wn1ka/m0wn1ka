Gas cost is the number of units of gas required to perform a particular operation.
• Gas price is the amount of ether you are willing to pay per unit of gas when you
send your transaction to the Ethereum network



Deleting a contract (SELFDESTRUCT) is worth a refund of 24,000 gas.
• Changing a storage address from a nonzero value to zero (SSTORE[x] = 0) is
worth a refund of 15,000 gas.



The block gas limit is the maximum amount of gas that may be consumed by all the
transactions in a block, and constrains how many transactions can fit into a block	


PoW consensus is a careful balance of risk
and reward that drives participants to behave honestly out of self-interest.

In general, a PoS algorithm works as follows. The blockchain keeps track of a set of
validators, and anyone who holds the blockchain’s base cryptocurrency (in Ethereum’s
case, ether) can become a validator by sending a special type of transaction that locks
up their ether into a deposit. The validators take turns proposing and voting on the
next valid block, and the weight of each validator’s vote depends on the size of its
deposit (i.e., stake). Importantly, a validator risks losing their deposit if the block they
staked it on is rejected by the majority of validators. Conversely, validators earn a
small reward, proportional to their deposited stake, for every block that is accepted
by the majority. Thus, PoS forces validators to act honestly and follow the consensus
rules, by a system of reward and punishment. The major difference between PoS and
PoW is that the punishment in PoS is intrinsic to the blockchain (e.g., loss of staked
ether), whereas in PoW the punishment is extrinsic (e.g., loss of funds spent on
electricity).



-> Ethash is dependent on the generation and
analysis of a large dataset, known as a directed acyclic graph (or, more simply, “the
DAG”). The DAG had an initial size of about 1 GB and will continue to slowly and
linearly grow in size, being updated once every epoch (30,000 blocks, or roughly 125
hours)

  Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps

 Redux is a state management library that you can use with any JS library or framewor

if the store is provided to the App.js (by wrapping the App component within the <Provider> </Provider> tag) 
hen all its children (children components of App.js) can also access the state of the application from the store. This makes it act as a global state


Reducers, as the name suggests, take in two things: previous state and an action. Then they reduce it (read it return) to one entity: the new updated instance of state


Whenever an action is dispatched, all the reducers are activated. Each reducer filters out the action using a switch
 statement switching on the action type. Whenever the switch statement matches with the action passed, the corresponding
 reducers take the necessary action to make the update and return a fresh new instance of the global state.
