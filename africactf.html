You're working as an intern at a cybersecurity firm, and your boss has given you a challenge to test your packet sniffing skills. The company's IT department suspects that someone on the network is using a weak password, and they've asked you to find it before the boss does.

Your task is to analyze the pcap file provided by the IT department and locate the password before your boss does. The pcap file contains network traffic captured from a computer connected to the company's network. The password has been hidden somewhere within the packets, and you'll need to use your packet sniffing skills to find it.
