      Solidity programs can contain a pragma directive that
specifies the minimum and maximum versions of Solidity that it is compatible with,
and can be used to compile your contract


->global objects in evm block, msg, and tx objects

->Solidity exposes a number
of EVM opcodes as predefined functions



->The msg object is the transaction call (EOA originated) or message call (contract ori‐
ginated) that launched this contract execution.


msg.sender
We’ve already used this one. It represents the address that initiated this contract
call, not necessarily the originating EOA that sent the transaction. If our contract
was called directly by an EOA transaction, then this is the address that signed the
transaction, but otherwise it will be a contract address.
msg.value
The value of ether sent with this call (in wei).
msg.gas
The amount of gas left in the gas supply of this execution environment. This was
deprecated in Solidity v0.4.21 and replaced by the gasleft function.
msg.data
The data payload of this call into our contract.
msg.sig
The first four bytes of the data payload, which is the function selector




The tx object provides a means of accessing transaction-related information:
tx.gas
tx.origin



->The block object contains information about the current block:
block hash
block number
block gas
block difficulty
block coin base:The address of the recipient of the current block’s fees and block reward.
block time stamp


address.balance
The balance of the address, in wei. For example, the current contract balance is
address(this).balance.
address.transfer(amount)
Transfers the amount (in wei) to this address, throwing an exception on any
error. We used this function in our Faucet example as a method on the
msg.sender address, as msg.sender.transfer



builtin funcitons
selfdestrunct(recipient_address)
Deletes the current contract, sending any remaining ether in the account to the
recipient address.

Solidity’s principal data type is contract; our Faucet example simply defines a
contract object. Similar to any object in an object-oriented language, the contract is
a container that includes data and methods.
->interface
->library




The syntax we use to declare a function in Solidity is as follows:
function FunctionName([parameters]) {public|private|internal|external}
[pure|constant|view|payable] [modifiers] [returns (return types)]



One function in each contract may be defined without a name, in which case it is
the fallback function, which is called when no other function is named. The fall‐
back function cannot have any arguments or return anything.


->external
External functions are like public functions, except they cannot be called from
within the contract unless explicitly prefixed with the keyword this
->The keywords described here only affect how and
when a function can be called.



payable
A payable function is one that can accept incoming payments. Functions not
declared as payable will reject incoming payments. There are two exceptions,
due to design decisions in the EVM: coinbase payments and SELFDESTRUCT
inheritance will be paid even if the fallback function is not declared as payable,
but this makes sense because code execution is not part of those payments
anyway

selfdestruct(address recipient);

->Our
constructor sets the owner variable, and the selfdestruct function will first check
that the owner called it directly


We used msg.sender in the
withdraw function to identify the initiator of the withdrawal request


pragma solidity ^0.4.2;
contract Faucet{
	address owner;
	constructor(){
		owner=msg.sender;
	}



-----------------------
function destroy()public{
	require(msg.sender==owner);
	selfdestruct(owner);
	}

------------
function modifiers:----
modifier onlyOwner{
	require(msg.sender==owner);
	_;
	}

----
(_;). This placeholder is
replaced by the code of the function that is being modified. Essentially, the modifier is
“wrapped around” the modified function, placing its code in the location identified
by the underscore character



To apply a modifier, you add its name to the function declaration. More than one
modifier can be applied to a function; they are applied in the sequence they are
declared, as a comma-separated list.
Let’s rewrite our destroy function to use the onlyOwner modifier:
function destroy() public onlyOwner {
 selfdestruct(owner);
}




Inside a modifier, you can access all the values (variables and arguments) visible to
the modified function. In this case, we can access the owner variable, which is
declared within the contract. However, the inverse is not true: you cannot access any
of the modifier’s variables inside the modified function.



contract Child is Parent1, Parent2 {
 ...
}





contract owned{
	address owner;
	constructor(){
		owner=msg.sender;
		}
	modifier onlyowner{
		require(msg.sender==owner);
		_;
		}
	}

contrat mortal is owned{
	function destroy() public onlyOwned{
		selfdestruct(owner);
		}
	}
-----------------------
contract Faucet is mortal{
	function withdraw(unit withdraw_amount)public{
		require(withdraw_amount<=0.1ether);
		msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);
		}
	function ()public payable{}




Error Handling (assert, require, revert)
By convention, assert
is used when the outcome is expected to be true, meaning that we use assert to test
internal conditions.
require(msg.sender == owner, "Only the contract owner can call this function");


The revert and throw functions halt the execution of the contract and revert any
state changes
The revert function can also take an
error message as the only argument, which is recorded in the transaction log

require(this.balance >= withdraw_amount,
"Insufficient balance in faucet for withdrawal request");
msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);
Additional error-checking code like this will increase gas consumption slightly, but it
offers better error reporting than if omitted



e transaction receipt contains log entries that provide
information about the actions that occurred during the execution of the transaction.
Events are the Solidity high-level objects that are used to construct these logs.


Events are especially useful for light clients and DApp services, which can “watch” for
specific events and report them to the user interface, or make a change in the state of
the application to reflect an event in an underlying contract.


Event objects take arguments that are serialized and recorded in the transaction logs,
in the blockchain. You can supply the keyword indexed before an argument, to make
the value part of an indexed table (hash table) that can be searched or filtered by an
application


define events
contract Faucet is mortal {
event Withdrawal(address indexed to, uint amount);
event Deposit(address indexed from, uint amount);


e emit keyword to incorporate the event data in the transaction logs:
function withdrdaw(uint withdraw_amount )public{
	msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);
	emit Withdrawl(msg.sender,,withdraw_amount);
	}
function ()public payable{
	emit Deposit(msg.sender,msg.value);


-----------------
Example 7-3. Faucet8.sol: Revised Faucet contract, with events
1 // Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for
2 pragma solidity ^0.4.22;
3
4 contract owned {
5 address owner;
6 // Contract constructor: set owner
7 constructor() {
8 owner = msg.sender;
9 }
10 // Access control modifier
11 modifier onlyOwner {
12 require(msg.sender == owner,
13 "Only the contract owner can call this function");
14 _;
15 }
16 }
17
18 contract mortal is owned {
19 // Contract destructor
20 function destroy() public onlyOwner {
21 selfdestruct(owner);
22 }
23 }
24
25 contract Faucet is mortal {
26 event Withdrawal(address indexed to, uint amount);
27 event Deposit(address indexed from, uint amount);
30 function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {
31 // Limit withdrawal amount
32 require(withdraw_amount <= 0.1 ether);
33 require(this.balance >= withdraw_amount,
34 "Insufficient balance in faucet for withdrawal request");
35 // Send the amount to the address that requested it
36 msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);
37 emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, withdraw_amount);
38 }
39 // Accept any incoming amount
40 function () public payable {
41 emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.value);
42 }
43 }




The web3.js library provides a data structure that con‐
tains a transaction’s logs. Within those we can see the events generated by the
transaction
