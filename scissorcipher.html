        The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher named after Julius Caesar,
         who reportedly used it to communicate with his officials. The technique involves 
         shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.
          For example, with a shift of 3, A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on
