  what i got from various sites
<pre>
  Analytics stores campaign source information. 
Each time the value of the campaign is updated, Analytics opens a new session
Generally speaking, the campaign updates anytime the user arrives at your site via a search engine, referring website
google client id:
In order for Google Analytics to determine which traffic belongs to which user, a unique identifier associated with
 each user is sent with each hit. This identifier can be a single, first-party cookie named _ga that stores a Google
 Analytics client ID
->he analytics.js library accomplishes this via the Client ID field, a unique, randomly generated string 
that gets stored in the browsers cookies, so subsequent visits to the same site can be associated with the same user.
->Other cookies created by analytics.js include _gid, AMP_TOKEN and _gac_<property-id>. These cookies
 store other randomly generated ids and campaign information about the user.
->Every time a hit is sent to Google Analytics, the cookie expiration time is updated to be the current
 time plus the value of the cookieExpires field
-> A web session ID is unique to a specific visit, while a cookie is unique to a specific visitor 
and thus (developers hope) remains the same through multiple web sessions. By mapping a single cookie 
ID to multiple session IDs, developers and analysts can get a clearer picture of how visitors interact 
with their web applications.



->A session creates a file in a temporary directory on the server where registered session variables 
and their values are stored. This data will be available to all pages on the site during that visit.

The location of the temporary file is determined by a setting in the php.ini file called session.save_path
. Before using any session variable make sure you have setup this path.



When a PHP script wants to retrieve the value from a session variable, PHP automatically gets the unique s
ession identifier string from the PHPSESSID cookie and then looks in its temporary directory for the file
 bearing that name and a validation can be done by comparing both value

simple counter

  session_start();
   
   if( isset( $_SESSION['counter'] ) ) {
      $_SESSION['counter'] += 1;
   }else {
      $_SESSION['counter'] = 1;
   }
	
   $msg = "You have visited this page ".  $_SESSION['counter'];

unset($_SESSION['counter']);
session_destroy();


->You don't need to call start_session() function to start a session when a user visits your site
 if you can set session.auto_start variable to 1 in php.ini file.

function frames stacks
Stack Frame:
Each function call creates a stack frame, which contains information such as the
 function's return address, parameters, local variables, and other bookkeeping data.
return addresses of program 

->non executeable stack
->Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR)
->canaries using(value placed just before return of control address,checks the present and predetermined value,if not same we can check or stop a 
rop  attack

strings:;
For each file given, GNU strings prints the printable character sequences that are
 at least 4 characters long (or the number given with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable
 character.

ast
The ast module in Python provides a way to work with abstract syntax trees (ASTs).
 It allows you to parse Python source code into an AST, analyze the structure of the code

, and perform various operations on it.



->The eval() function in Python is a built-in function that evaluates a given expression 
as a Python expression and returns the res


->The all() function in Python is a built-in function that returns True if all elements
 in an iterable are true (or if the iterable is empty), and False otherwise


->compile() function is used to compile source code into a code object or an AST
 (Abstract Syntax Tree) object. The compile() function takes three main arguments:
 source, filename, and mode

->exec() function is a built-in function used to execute dynamically created Python 
code or statements. It allows you to run Python code stored in strings or code objects

->Dynamic import, also known as dynamic module loading or runtime module loading, is
 a feature in some programming languages that allows modules or libraries to be loaded 
and imported at runtime, rather than statically at compile-time or startup.


->__import__('os'): This dynamically imports the os module using the __import__() function.
 The __import__() function is a low-level function in Python that allows you to import modules
 by providing the module name as a string.

<--,__import__('os').system('cat flag.txt')-->


myTuple = ("John", "Peter", "Vicky")

x = "#".join(myTuple)

print(x)
