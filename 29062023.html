  what i got from various sites
<pre>
  Analytics stores campaign source information. 
Each time the value of the campaign is updated, Analytics opens a new session
Generally speaking, the campaign updates anytime the user arrives at your site via a search engine, referring website
google client id:
In order for Google Analytics to determine which traffic belongs to which user, a unique identifier associated with
 each user is sent with each hit. This identifier can be a single, first-party cookie named _ga that stores a Google
 Analytics client ID
->he analytics.js library accomplishes this via the Client ID field, a unique, randomly generated string 
that gets stored in the browsers cookies, so subsequent visits to the same site can be associated with the same user.
->Other cookies created by analytics.js include _gid, AMP_TOKEN and _gac_<property-id>. These cookies
 store other randomly generated ids and campaign information about the user.
->Every time a hit is sent to Google Analytics, the cookie expiration time is updated to be the current
 time plus the value of the cookieExpires field
-> A web session ID is unique to a specific visit, while a cookie is unique to a specific visitor 
and thus (developers hope) remains the same through multiple web sessions. By mapping a single cookie 
ID to multiple session IDs, developers and analysts can get a clearer picture of how visitors interact 
with their web applications.



->A session creates a file in a temporary directory on the server where registered session variables 
and their values are stored. This data will be available to all pages on the site during that visit.

The location of the temporary file is determined by a setting in the php.ini file called session.save_path
. Before using any session variable make sure you have setup this path.



When a PHP script wants to retrieve the value from a session variable, PHP automatically gets the unique s
ession identifier string from the PHPSESSID cookie and then looks in its temporary directory for the file
 bearing that name and a validation can be done by comparing both value

simple counter

  session_start();
   
   if( isset( $_SESSION['counter'] ) ) {
      $_SESSION['counter'] += 1;
   }else {
      $_SESSION['counter'] = 1;
   }
	
   $msg = "You have visited this page ".  $_SESSION['counter'];

unset($_SESSION['counter']);
session_destroy();


->You don't need to call start_session() function to start a session when a user visits your site
 if you can set session.auto_start variable to 1 in php.ini file.
