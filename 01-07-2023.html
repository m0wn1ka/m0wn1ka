     more advanced category of mathematical functions that is useful in cryptography is
based on arithmetic operations on an elliptic curve. In elliptic curve arithmetic, mul‐
tiplication modulo a prime is simple but division (the inverse) is practically impossi‐
ble. This is called the discrete logarithm problem and there are currently no known
trapdoors. Elliptic curve cryptography is used extensively in modern computer sys‐
tems and is the basis of Ethereum’s (and other cryptocurrencies’) use of private keys
and digital signatures


->In Ethereum, we use public key cryptography (also known as asymmetric cryptogra‐
phy


->They are considered a “pair” because the public key is derived from the private keyTogether, they represent an Ethereum account by providing, respectively, a publicly
accessible account handle (the address) and private control over access to any ether in
the account and over any authentication the account needs when using smart con‐
tracts. The private key controls access by being the unique piece of information
needed to create digital signatures, which are required to sign transactions to spend
any funds in the account. Digital signatures are also used to authenticate owners or
users of contracts


-> The mathematics of cryptog‐
raphy—in this case, elliptic curve cryptography—provides a way for the message (i.e.,
the transaction details) to be combined with the private key to create a code that can
only be produced with knowledge of the private key. That code is called the digital
signature


->Elliptic curve mathematics means that anyone can ver‐
ify that a transaction is valid, by checking that the digital signature matches the trans‐
action details and the Ethereum address to which access is being requested. The
verification doesn’t involve the private key at all; that remains private. However, the
verification process determines beyond doubt that the transaction could have only
come from someone with the private key that corresponds to the public key behind
the Ethereum address. This is the “magic” of public key cryptography.




->K = k * G, where k is the private key, G is a constant
point called the generator point, K is the resulting public key, and * is the special elliptic curve multiplication


->Elliptic curve multiplication is a type of function that cryptogra‐
phers call a “one-way” function: it is easy to do in one direction
(multiplication) and impossible to do in the reverse direction (divi‐
sion).


->At a high level, a wallet is a software application that serves as the primary user inter‐
face to Ethereum. The wallet controls access to a user’s money, managing keys and
addresses, tracking the balance, and creating and signing transactions. In addition,
some Ethereum wallets can also interact with contracts, such as ERC20 tokens.


->The ether or other
tokens are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain. Users control the tokens on the
network by signing transactions with the keys in their wallets. In a sense, an Ether‐
eum wallet is a keychain


->you can move your account handling from
your current wallet to a different wallet, if you grow to dislike the wallet app you
started out using


->s. Users sign
transactions with the private keys, thereby proving they own the
ether. The ether is stored on the blockchain



->if someone gets hold of your mnemonic code words, then they can also recreate your
wallet and thus gain access to your ether and smart contracts.



->Transactions are signed messages originated by an externally owned account, trans‐
mitted by the Ethereum network, and recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.t they are the only things that can trigger
 a change of state,
or cause a contract to execute in the EVM




->A transaction is a serialized binary message that contains the following data:
Nonce
A sequence number, issued by the originating EOA, used to prevent message
replay

Gas price
The price of gas (in wei) the originator is willing to pay
Gas limit
The maximum amount of gas the originator is willing to buy for this transaction
Recipient
The destination Ethereum address
Value
The amount of ether to send to the destination
Data
The variable-length binary data payload
v,r,s
The three components of an ECDSA digital signature of the originating EOA


->The transaction message’s structure is serialized using the Recursive Length Prefix
(RLP) encoding scheme, which was created specifically for simple, byte-perfect data
serialization in Ethereum
er metadata frequently added to the
transaction by client software includes the block number (once it is mined and
included in the blockchain) and a transaction ID (calculated hash).


-> this data is
derived from the transaction, and does not form part of the transaction message
itself.


*nonce 

In practical terms, the nonce is an up-to-date count of the number of confirmed (i.e.,
on-chain) transactions that have originated from an account

mempool


->A transaction with only value is a payment. A transaction with only data is an invoca‐
tion. A transaction with both value and data is both a payment and an invocation. A
transaction with neither value nor data—well that’s probably just a waste of gas! But it
is still possible.



->When you construct an Ethereum transaction that contains a value, it is the equiva‐
lent of a payment. Such transactions behave differently depending on whether the
destination address is a contract or not.


->If the destination address (to) is a contract, then the EVM will execute the contract
and will attempt to call the function named in the data payload of your transaction. If
there is no data in your transaction, the EVM will call a fallback function and, if that
function is payable, will execute it to determine what to do next. If there is no fallback
function, then the effect of the transaction will be to increase the balance of the con‐
tract, exactly like a payment to a wallet.

->A contract can reject incoming payments by throwing an exception immediately
when a function is called, or as determined by conditions coded in a function


->Contract creation transactions are sent
to a special destination address called the zero address; the to field in a contract regis‐
tration transaction contains the address 0x0.


->A contract creation transaction need only contain a data payload that contains the
compiled bytecode which will create the contract.
