Welcome to "Operation Cipher Vault," an immersive CTF challenge inspired by the world of secret service operations. You have been recruited 
   as an elite agent to infiltrate a highly secure facility known as the Cipher Vault. Your mission is to obtain a confidential flag hidden deep
   within the vault's mainframe. The vault's security relies on a password input field that triggers an error on improper password length. Your task
   is to exploit this vulnerability, crack the password, and retrieve the top-secret flag to complete your mission.
