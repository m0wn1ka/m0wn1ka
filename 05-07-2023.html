->Oracles, ideally, provide a trustless (or at least near-trustless) way of getting extrinsic
(i.e., “rea-world” or off-chain) information, such as the results of football games, the
price of gold, or truly random numbers, onto the Ethereum platform for smart con‐
tracts to use. 

->All oracles provide a few key functions, by definition. These include the ability to:
• Collect data from an off-chain source.
• Transfer the data on-chain with a signed message.
• Make the data available by putting it in a smart contract’s storage.


->The three main ways to set up an oracle can be categorized as request–response,

->authenticity proofs and trusted execution environments (TEEs)


->thenticity proofs are cryptographic guarantees that data has not been tampered
with. Based on a variety of attestation techniques (e.g., digitally signed proofs), they
effectively shift the trust from the data carrier to the attestor (i.e., the provider of the
attestation).

decentralised oracles 

ChainLink has proposed a decentralized oracle network consisting of three key smart
contracts—a reputation contract, an order-matching contract, and an aggregation
contract—and an off-chain registry of data providers. The reputation contract is used
to keep track of data providers’ performance. Scores in the reputation contract are
used to populate the off-chain registry. The order-matching contract selects bids from
oracles using the reputation contract. It then finalizes a service-level agreement,
which includes query parameters and the number of oracles requi
